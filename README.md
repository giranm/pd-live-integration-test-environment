# PagerDuty Live Integration Test Environment (Terraform)

This repo hosts Terraform code for a PagerDuty environment that is used to perform integration tests for [PagerDuty Live](https://github.com/giranm/pd-live-react).

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/), therefore documentation will be kept to a minimum. We would encourage newer readers to review our [quickstart project](https://github.com/giranm/pagerduty-terraform-quickstart) to see how PagerDuty objects can be managed using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) via Terraform.
